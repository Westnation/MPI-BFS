# MPI-BFS
Parallel realisation of breadth-first search algorithm using MPI (serial realisation included)

Before start:
- This code was written during my education and fully-filled with on the verge of fail decisions
- Included graph generator is represented only for demonstration purposes and not meant to be good
- Generated matrix and distance vectors can be saved in separate file for further comparasion
- Time comparasion of serial and parallel realisations is included

Usage:
- Compile using any mpi-compatible compiler
- Run with needed number of ranks
- After start enter number of vertices, then choose whether save results of computing or not
